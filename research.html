            When robots are deployed in novel environments, developers cannot
            fully foresee what errors the robots may make, what may be the root
            causes of such errors, how human confidence in the robotsâ€™ abilities
            may change as a result of such errors, and how well the robots may
            learn to autonomously overcome errors and reduce the reliance on
            human assistance. This project develops a comprehensive solution to
            these challenges by introducing competence-aware autonomy, enabling
            robots to learn what aspects of the environment, the situation, and
            the task lead to varying levels of success. Consequently, the
            project transforms the ability of researchers and practitioners to
            deploy robots in unstructured environments where limited knowledge
            is available prior to deployment. This enables workers with limited
            robotics expertise to deploy robots more safely in unstructured
            environments and teach them over time to be progressively
            independent. More information is available on the

            SMADS is a case study on the development of an end-to-end software
            stack to facilitate autonomous delivery by a fleet of heterogeneous
            robots in an urban environment. This system includes the ability for
            users to query an autonomous delivery via an iOS application and
            track progress while the robot is en route to the delivery location.
            This system has successfully been deployed over 5 business days as a
            lemonade delivery system on the UT Campus and highlights challenges
            in the current state of the art approaches to navigation and
            localization in urban environments with complex terrain, vehicles
            and crowds of pedestrians. This project was inspired by the idea of
            using robotics and A.I. to help solve societal problems and was
            funded under UT
            <a href="https://bridgingbarriers.utexas.edu/">Good Systems</a>

                  Vision, as an inexpensive yet information rich sensor, is
                  commonly used for perception on autonomous mobile robots.
                  However, vision systems are prone to errors from various
                  sources such as image saturation, blur, and texture-less
                  scenes. In this project, we develop an approach for
                  self-supervised learning of a model that can predict failures
                  of stereo vision-based obstacle avoidance systems. The learned
                  model predicts the probability of different types of failure
                  (false positive and false negative) and pinpoints the location
                  of the error on the input image. (<a href="/papers/iVOA.pdf"

                  Expanding A* is an anytime multiagent path planner which
                  leverages two observations: 1) conflicts between multi-agent
                  plans often have geometrically local resolutions within a
                  small repair window, even if such local resolutions are not
                  globally optimal; and 2) the partial search tree for such
                  local resolutions can then be iteratively improved over
                  successively larger windows to eventually compute the global
                  optimal plan. X* operates by replanning locally, and then, as
                  shown in the image, growing the scope of the local repair as
                  time permits. (<a

                  State machines are a common tool for building controllers for
                  various robotic tasks. The effectiveness of a state machine is
                  often dependent on the parameters used for transition and
                  emissions, and in many cases these parameters are a source of
                  human introduced error. The goal of this research is to create
                  a system which does the following: 1) Identifies state
                  machines and extract their parameters from source code using
                  static analysis. 2) Detects faults in these state machines via
                  anomaly detection or domain-specific error functions. 3)
                  Identifies a modification to the transition and emission
                  parameters for the state machine that corrects the error. (<a

                  including service mobile robots, warehouse robots, and robot
                  soccer. Despite their popularity, true time-optimal control of
                  omnidirectional robots with acceleration and velocity limits
                  remains an unsolved problem. This research aims to develop

                  Our robots present an array of interesting research problems,
                  as evidence by what is described here. Given their intriguing
                  capabilities, we desired to share them with novices. In order
                  to make this possible, we had to ensure safety of both users
                  and robots as well as a much easier development experience.
                  This involved significant engineering in building out a
                  carefully designed layer of abstraction on top of the existing
                  <a href="/minutebots">Minutebots</a> codebase. Further efforts
                  made programming and viewing the robots possible solely in a

                  Skid-steer drive systems are widely used in mobile robot
                  platforms. Such systems are subject to significant slippage
                  and skidding during normal operation due to their nature. The
                  ability to predict and compensate for such slippages in the
                  forward kinematics of these types of robots is of great
                  importance and provides the means for accurate control and

                  Having an accurate motion model for a robot is equivalent to
                  being able to accurately predict the behavior of the robot,
                  which in turn provides the means for accurate control.
                  Learning a motion model could be achieved through various
                  system identification methods, which essentially train a
                  function approximator for this purpose. However, the dynamics
                  of a robot could not always be expressed within one single
                  model, or in order for a single model to be complex and
                  expressive enough, one should train it with extensive amount
                  of training data. We approach this problem by breaking it into
                  smaller pieces and learn multiple simple models rather than
                  one single complex model. The robot could then switch between
                  these models and choose the appropriate one at each time. We
                  apply this method to the case of a ground robot and show how
                  multiple models could be learned for different types of
                  terrain to improve the overall motion model accuracy for the
                  robot.

                  Delta-Calibration is an automatic method for extrinsic
                  calibration of sensors based on ego-motion. Delta-Calibration
                  involves a closed form solution to the extrinsic calibration
                  given necessary ego-motions performed by rigid bodies of
                  connected sensors. An optimization based solution to
                  Delta-Calibration can calculate even with limited axes of
                  ego-motion, and limited information in the environment. (<a

                  Autonomous mapping of environments is challenging, especially
                  when areas may be very large and subject to frequent minor
                  changes. Currently, fully autonomous state-of-the-art mapping
                  methods still struggle when faced with difficult environments
                  and/or novice users. Using a variety of analytical and
                  non-linear optimization tools, this project is aimed at
                  boosting the accuracy and success rates of mapping algorithms,
                  with minimal effort from a human. (<a

                  This research focuses on integrated planning and perception
                  for local obstacle avoidance using stereo RGB cameras for
                  autonomous mobile robots. By integrating planning and
                  perception, we expect to significantly reduce the
                  computational requirements for safe navigation, while still
                  remaining robust to arbitrary obstacles in the robotâ€™s path.
                  The test platform for this research is a Clearpath Jackal UGV.

                  One of the common approaches to motion planning in continuous
                  space is to discretize the search space using a graph or tree
                  and search over that reduced space. There are many approaches
                  and decompositions that aid in constructing such graphs. In
                  order to supplement these existing graph planning algorithms
                  in dynamic domains with moving obstacles, we introduce
                  strategies for supplementing probabilistic roadmaps with
                  dynamic obstacle-dependent sub-graphs to aid in the search of
                  high-quality paths while requiring only a coarse offline
                  graph. (<a

                  In order for robots to engage fully with humans, they must be
                  able to communicate with multiple humans simultaneously. This
                  project aims to develop an omni-directional interface for
                  multiple humans to ask a robot questions and a method for
                  finding the most useful way for the robot to answer all of
                  those questions simultaneously.
