                                    Computer Sciences, UMass Amherst. I received
                                    my PhD in Robotics in 2014 from Carnegie
                                    Mellon University, and my B.Tech in

                                    Institute of Technology, Bombay. My ultimate
                                    goal is to have self-sufficient autonomous
